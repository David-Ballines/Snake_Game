# Snake_Game
My rendition of the classic Snake game

# Instructions
The snake starts at the top left corner of the board. To move the snake press one of the four arrow keys. Move the snake to collect the orange pellets to gain another section. Avoid touching sections of the snake body with the head. 
You can set the walls to either be hassards or wrap around when you touch them by changing the "wrap" variable to true or false.

# Installation
1. Download the repository files from the download section
2. Import the files into any Java IDE
3.Run the application
