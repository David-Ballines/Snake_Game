# Snake Game

Rendition of the classic video game Snake. The objective of the game is to collect the orange circles on the board while trying not to touch any of your body sections. After the leading section of the snake goes over the orange a new section will be added to the end of the snake. There is a "wrap" boolean on line 49 in class "Gameplay" that can be set to true or false. When the boolean is set to true the snake can pass through the walls of the play area and wrap around to the other side. If the boolean is set to true, the game will end if the leading section hits the wall. The speed of the snake can be modified by changing the variable delay, making the number higher will make the snake move slower while decreasing the number will make it move faster.
You move the leading section of the snake by using the arrow keys on your keyboard.
